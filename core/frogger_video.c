 * frogger_video.c - Galaxian-style tilemap and sprites, drawn straight into the rotated frame.
 *
 * The cabinet's monitor is turned 90 degrees, so a raw scanline runs down the screen as we see
 * it. That is worth leaning into: we render one display row at a time, and because a display
 * row is a fixed raw x, it sits entirely inside one tilemap column - so the column's scroll and
 * colour are fetched once per row and the writes run straight down the frame buffer.
 *
 * That per-column vertical scroll is what makes the game: rotated, it becomes the sideways
 * drift of the traffic lanes and the logs.
